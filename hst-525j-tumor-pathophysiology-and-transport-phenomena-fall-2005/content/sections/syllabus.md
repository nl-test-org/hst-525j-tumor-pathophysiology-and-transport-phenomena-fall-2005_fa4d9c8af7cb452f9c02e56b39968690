Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

Description
-----------

Tumor pathophysiology plays a central role in the growth, invasion, metastasis and treatment of solid tumors. This class applies principles of transport phenomena to develop a systems-level, quantitative understanding of angiogenesis, blood flow and microcirculation, metabolism and microenvironment, transport and binding of small and large molecules, movement of cancer and immune cells, metastatic process, and treatment response.

Requirements
------------

There are no exams in this class, but there is a substantial term paper. Each student must prepare an in-class presentation on his or her paper, and the last two days of class are devoted to these presentations.
