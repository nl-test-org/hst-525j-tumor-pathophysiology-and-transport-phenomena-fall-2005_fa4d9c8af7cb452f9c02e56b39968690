Term Paper Instructions
-----------------------

The term paper will take the form of an original research proposal. As a general guideline, students should follow the typical outline of an NIH grant proposal (hypothesis, introduction, specific aims, detailed methods, references), although exceptions can be made with our approval. The topic must be related to cancer research and is chosen by the student. The proposal should not be similar to the student's ongoing research. The proposal should not be simply a review of the current literature, but should contain a novel hypothesis based on the current state of the research. There is a ten page limit.
